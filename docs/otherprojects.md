## Modules using sodium-native
Some JavaScript modules using sodium-native. See the full list [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium-native).

* [sodium-encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium-encryption): Sodium encryption that works in ![sodium-native][node] and in ![sodium-javascript][js].
* [secure-password](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secure-password): Making password storage safer for all.
* [secure-destroy-key](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secure-destroy-key): Destroy a secure buffer key safely. A piece in the puzzle towards [secure-key-management](https://github.com/emilbayes/secure-key-management).
* [secure-create-key](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secure-create-key): Create a symmetric cryptographic key in a secure, read-only buffer. A piece in the puzzle towards [secure-key-management](https://github.com/emilbayes/secure-key-management).
* [secure-read-key](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secure-read-key): Read a key safely into a secure, read-only buffer. A piece in the puzzle towards [secure-key-management](https://github.com/emilbayes/secure-key-management).
* [bitcoin-consensus-encoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoin-consensus-encoding): Abstract encoding for Bitcoin related objects.
* [minisign](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minisign): JavaScript implementation of Frank Denis' (@jedisct1) [minisign tool](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/). It is a CLI tool to perform minisign operations.
* [signature-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signature-request): Sign HTTP requests using modern crypto.
* [fastify-secure-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-secure-session): Create a secure stateless cookie session for Fastify, based on libsodium's [Secret Key Box Encryption](secretkeyboxencryption) and [fastify-cookie](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cookie).
* [noise-protocol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noise-protocol): JavaScript implementation of the Noise Protocol Framework based on [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/). Note that this implementation is low level and requires knowledge of the [Noise Protocol Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html), and is aimed to be a building block for higher-level modules wishing to implement application-specific handshakes securely.
* [secretstream-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secretstream-stream): Abstract encoding API of libsodium's [crypto_secretstream](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/secret-key_cryptography/secretstream).
* [ElectronMail](https://github.com/vladimiry/ElectronMail) (via [fs-json-store-encryption-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-json-store-encryption-adapter)): Unofficial ProtonMail Desktop App.
